# How to Add Screenshots to Your README

## Instructions:

1. Save your three screenshots with these exact names in the `screenshots/` folder:
   - `screenshot1.png` - The initial upload interface (first image you showed)
   - `screenshot2.png` - The analysis results page (second image)
   - `screenshot3.png` - The file selection dialog (third image)

2. You can take screenshots by:
   - Press `Windows + Shift + S` to use Snipping Tool
   - Or use your browser's screenshot feature
   - Save them in PNG format

3. The screenshots are already referenced in README.md at the correct paths

## Current Screenshot References in README:

- `screenshots/screenshot1.png` - Upload Interface
- `screenshots/screenshot2.png` - Analysis Results  
- `screenshots/screenshot3.png` - File Selection Dialog

## Alternative: Use the images directly from your attachments

Since you already have the screenshots displayed, you can:
1. Right-click on each browser window showing your app
2. Select "Save page as screenshot" or take a screenshot
3. Save them in the `screenshots/` folder with the names above

The README has been updated to include these images in a beautiful Screenshots section!
